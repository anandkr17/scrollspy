          <h4>Section 1 - Mumbai</h4>
          <p>
            As the saying goes, “Mumbai is the city, Bombay is the emotion”. And, that’s the thing: this city wears its heart — an inimitable blend of soul, style and swagger — on its sleeve. Between activist-led art galleries, historic former palaces, cutting-edge fashion designers and some of the best-rated restaurants on the planet, there’s plenty to do and see: be it amid the car-honking thrum of the action or whiling away the day on the beach with your toes in the cerulean Arabian Sea.
            Where to stay Soho House Mumbai, the group’s lively first outpost in Asia, on the shores of funky Juhu Beach.

            <h4>Section 2 - Jaipur</h4>
            <p>
              India’s celebrated “Pink City” has played muse to almost every designer and photographer on the planet. Leading the way in everything from printed batik textiles and ceramics to emerald cutting, Jaipur has long been a hotbed of creative talent that now extends to a world-famous literary festival. Lauded too, for its architecture — everything from the blush-toned Amber Fort to its iconic havelis and opulent, jewel-toned palaces — this is a city, and an aesthete’s dreamland, that stands apart from all others.
              Where to stay Ever wondered how royalty might live? Silly question, we know. Book into the Rajmahal Palace, where Jaipur’s Maharaja still officially resides, and find out for yourself.

            <h4>Section 3 - Rishikesh</h4>
           <p>
            When The Beatles bedded down at a Himalayan ashram in the Sixties, an entire hemisphere was let in on a spiritual secret. Long revered by Hindus as a pilgrimage site and in India as the birthplace of yoga, Rishikesh is home to the earliest recorded ashram. It’s believed that meditation and a dip in the Ganges — here at its purest accessible point, amid quick-flowing waters below forested peaks — help fast-track you towards enlightenment. Make sure you’re in town for sunset, when a breeze races down the river and intensifies the peal of the temple bells ahead of the ganga aarti (river worship ceremony).
Where to stay One of the world’s best spa hotels, Ananda in the Himalayas, is a 30-minute drive into the mountains.

            <h4>Section 4 - Jodhpur</h4>
            <p>
              Rajasthan’s “cobalt city” — a much-searched reminder of Jodhpur’s Brahmins, who painted their walls blue to deter insects and keep the city cool in summer — may appear to play second fiddle to its more famous rosy-hued sister, but that doesn’t mean it ought to; this place is magnetic enough by itself. Home to the mighty Mehrangarh Fort, which is one of the country’s most magnificent, as well as the Mandore Gardens (where the Maharajas lived before they upping sticks to Mehrangarh) and the Jaswant Thada memorial, it’s one of the most important architectural sites in the country. Don’t miss the lakes, either; the natural ecology surrounding the area is outstanding.
              Where to stay The Umaid Bhawan is one of the most opulent hotels in India; it was the last palace to be built prior to Indian independence.

            <h4>Section 5 - Chennai</h4>
            <p>
              Few things are as synonymous with India as cricket; but fewer know that the mothership itself is Chennai — the sprawling, steamy capital of Tamil Nadu — and here, the hottest ticket in town is an Indian Premier League (IPL) match. The city is a great introduction to southern India; there’s everything from delicious and innovative vegetarian cooking to mind-blowing art. It’s hardly surprising, given it’s often touted as the cultural hub of India. Plus, you’re a stone’s throw from some of the region’s best sands, whether that’s Chennai’s famed Marina Beach, one of the world’s longest city beaches, or a quick flight to the paradisical Andaman Islands.
              Where to stay If it’s next-level food you’re after, there’s nowhere better than ITC Grand Chola: the hotel group is renowned for discovering up-and-coming Indian chefs.

            <h4>Section 6 - Kolkata
            </h4>
            <p>
              Chosen as the base of the British Raj during their colonisation of India, this formerly prosperous city — then known as Calcutta — was revoked of its capital city status when it became the centre of the Indian independence movement. Now, rebounding from the period of economic and political turbulence that followed, Kolkata is back on the up; this creative and vivacious city has spent recent years as Gen Z’s best-kept secret. Beloved especially by foodies, it’s widely regarded as one of the most exciting places to eat in the country; here, you’ll find up-and-coming culinary and mixology talents, as well as a fresher take on traditionally stuffy Indian hospitality, at affordable prices.
              Where to stay The Corner Courtyard, in busy Lansdowne, is one of the best in town; seven unique rooms and a funky atmosphere, with one of the city’s most popular restaurants on-site.

            <h4>Section 7 - New Delhi
            </h4>
            <p>
              India’s thrumming capital is home to 19 million people; and here, you’ll find some of the world’s most exciting talents in fashion, art, food and technology, as well as some of the world’s most famous sights from Qutub Minar and Jantar Mantar to India Gate. Plus, you get two (three, if you count hip sister city, Gurgaon) radically different places in one; Old Delhi (called ‘Purani Dilli’) — the otherworldly original city — and New Delhi, the metropolis created as a base for the British Raj during their colonisation of India.
Where to stay Oberoi New Delhi for staggering views of Unesco heritage site Humayun’s Tomb and some of the country’s best service.
